            <blockquote>
<p>The following was written as a foreword to the 2015 Scratch Conference in Amsterdam. It’s pretty similar to my post ‘Making vs Coding’, but I thought I’d post it here anyway. Enjoy!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think if I had to narrow down a list of  the most valuable things Scratch has taught me, I could pick two things: creativity and community. On Scratch the two ideas are intrinsically linked.</p>
<p>When I create a project on Scratch and then share it, I am inviting others to join in the process. Others suggestions help me refine or take the project further. Someone suggests a great piece of music to put behind my project or my younger sister volunteers to make an 8-bit character for me and it’s no longer just my project but our project.  It’s not necessarily about what I can create but about what we, collectively can create. Creativity enhances community, and community enhances creativity.</p>
<p>The creative community has been a core element of Scratch.  Creative collaboration over competition. We become better coders, create more interesting projects and learn when we work together in community. Scratch has had a vital role in teaching me to work and learn in community.</p>
<p>Largely because of my foundation with Scratch, computing has always been an inherently creative platform. I was introduced to Scratch by my Dad when I was eight and it almost immediately captured my imagination, not because of what I could program, but because of the worlds I could create.</p>
<p>I’ve always disliked the “get a better job” rationale as the sole reason for learning to code. Computing can, and should be so much more than just a tool. When I teach Scratch, I never do it because I expect my students to become computer scientists. I do it so that they have another outlet for creativity that they might not otherwise have access to.</p>
<p>Sometimes today’s computing culture feels like a battle of designer vs developer - art opposing logic. If anything, CS should bridge the gap between hard logic and creative art. Computers are strictly logical at their core, but as a tool they can be used for unique experiences that are more art than anything else.</p>
<p>See, Scratch has never really been about programming to me. It has always been about programming as a medium for creative expression. Creativity through programming. And not only that, but sharing your experiences with others, for them to build on and improve.</p>
<p><em>I don’t like coding, I like making.</em></p>
